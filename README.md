# $AVAX Physical Coins Design
 
> [Avalanche](https://www.avalabs.org/) is an open-source platform for launching highly decentralized applications, new financial primitives, and new interoperable blockchains.

You could say I'm a Avalanche believer, so I made this design. There're also NFTs(100 copyies) minted on the Avalacnche network. 

For it's a crypto-related design project, I also uploaded the svg file to IPFS, you may find them with CIDs as followed.
